Schema should be used as a software development tool in the implementation of ITxPT IP service using XML or JSON payloads. It can validate that an data structure is well formed and compliant with the structure defined in the related ITxPT specification. In some cases, Schema can be used to automate/simplify the generation of payload structure at coding level.
